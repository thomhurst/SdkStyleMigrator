# Expert Detail Questions - SdkMigrator Analysis

## Q6: Should the tool preserve ALL custom Import statements (including third-party .targets/.props files) found in LegacyProjectElements.cs during migration?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (breaking custom build logic would prevent successful migrations)

## Q7: When generating multi-targeting projects in CleanSdkStyleProjectGenerator.cs, should conditional ItemGroups be automatically created for framework-specific dependencies?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (this is standard practice for multi-targeting libraries)

## Q8: Should the tool automatically detect and set the correct SDK type (Razor, Blazor, Worker) based on project content analysis in ProjectTypeDetector.cs?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (incorrect SDK type causes build failures)

## Q9: Should migration performance be improved by implementing package version caching similar to the clean-deps command implementation?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (large solutions with many packages benefit significantly from caching)

## Q10: Should the tool generate a detailed migration report file documenting all changes made and manual steps required post-migration?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (users need audit trails and guidance for completing migrations)
