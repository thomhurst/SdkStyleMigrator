# Features Added from Comprehensive Analysis

This document lists all the features that were added based on the comprehensive analysis of SDK-style migration challenges.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced MSBuild Analysis - Capture Removed Custom Targets Content
- Added `RemovedMSBuildElement` model to capture full XML content of removed elements
- Enhanced `MigrateCustomTargetsAndImports` to capture and provide migration guidance
- Provides specific suggestions for migrating common targets (BeforeBuild, AfterBuild, etc.)
- Preserves custom targets that aren't common MSBuild targets

### 2. Fix Content Items Handling for Non-Web SDKs
- Added intelligent content item detection for packaging scenarios
- Created `IsContentForPackaging` helper to identify package content files
- Added `GetPackagePath` helper to determine correct package paths
- Properly handles readme, license, icon files for NuGet packages

### 3. Central Package Management Support
- Created `ICentralPackageManagementGenerator` interface and implementation
- Generates `Directory.Packages.props` file with all package references
- Handles version conflict resolution (picks highest version)
- Detects and handles analyzer packages as GlobalPackageReferences
- Removes version attributes from project files when enabled
- Added `--central-package-management` CLI option

### 4. Web Site Project Detection
- Added detection for Web Site Projects (App_Code, App_Data folders)
- Warns users that Web Site Projects cannot be migrated
- Suggests converting to Web Application Projects first

### 5. Multi-targeting Support
- Added `TargetFrameworks` array to `MigrationOptions`
- Modified `SdkStyleProjectGenerator.MigrateProperties` to handle multi-targeting
- Added `--target-frameworks` CLI option for specifying multiple frameworks
- Warns for library projects when multi-targeting is enabled

### 6. Post-migration Validation
- Created `IPostMigrationValidator` interface and implementation
- Validates SDK attribute, target framework, package references
- Checks for common migration issues and anti-patterns
- Provides severity levels (Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
- Integrates validation results into migration report warnings

### 7. Configuration Migration Guidance
- Created `ConfigurationMigrationAnalyzer` to analyze web.config/app.config
- Provides detailed migration steps for each configuration section
- Includes code examples for common migration scenarios
- Handles authentication, session state, connection strings, appSettings
- Adds guidance to the detailed migration report

## ðŸ”„ Partially Implemented / In Progress

### 8. Memory Management for Large Solutions
- Basic batch processing support via `MaxDegreeOfParallelism`
- Would benefit from additional memory optimization for very large solutions

### 9. Cross-platform Case Sensitivity
- Basic handling in place, but could be enhanced for edge cases

### 10. Progress Tracking for Resumable Migrations
- Backup sessions provide some resumability
- Could add checkpoint system for long-running migrations

### 11. JSON Output Format
- Migration report is currently text-based
- Could add JSON output option for CI/CD integration

## Key Implementation Details

### Private NuGet Repository Support
- Discovers NuGet sources from system configuration
- Supports custom NuGet.config files via `--nuget-config` option
- Uses NuGet Settings API to load all configured sources

### Multi-assembly Package Handling
- Tracks all assemblies included in packages (e.g., EntityFramework)
- Prevents duplicate Reference tags for multi-DLL packages
- Maintains mapping of known multi-assembly packages

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Defensive project parsing for invalid imports
- Comprehensive error logging and audit trail
- Graceful handling of missing or corrupted project files

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Enable Central Package Management
SdkMigrator ./src --central-package-management

# Multi-targeting
SdkMigrator ./src --target-frameworks net8.0 net472

# With custom NuGet config
SdkMigrator ./src --nuget-config ./custom-nuget.config

# Full migration with all features
SdkMigrator ./src --target-frameworks net8.0 net472 --central-package-management --parallel 4
```

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles most common SDK migration scenarios
2. **Safety**: Validation ensures migrated projects are properly configured
3. **Guidance**: Provides actionable guidance for manual migration steps
4. **Flexibility**: Supports various project types and configurations
5. **Enterprise Ready**: Handles private NuGet feeds and complex dependency scenarios
